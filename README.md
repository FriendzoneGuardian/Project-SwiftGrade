# Project SwiftGrade

## Overview

Project SwiftGrade is an advanced academic software suite designed to facilitate automated grading and analysis of student assessments through the integration of Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies. This repository serves as the central hub for all core components, including preprocessing modules, AI/ML models, user interface elements, and utility scripts.

The primary objective of SwiftGrade is to streamline the grading process, reduce manual workload for educators, and enhance the objectivity and consistency of assessment evaluations. By leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning models alongside traditional checksum verification techniques, the system aims to accurately interpret and score both multiple-choice and essay-type responses.

## Installation and Setup

To ensure reproducibility and environment consistency, it is strongly recommended to use Python virtual environments (`venv`) or containerization (e.g., Docker) for dependency management.

### Example Setup Using `venv`:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate      # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Branching Strategy
main: Stable production-ready code. All features must be fully tested and reviewed before merging.

dev: Active development branch for UI/UX enhancements and integration testing.
