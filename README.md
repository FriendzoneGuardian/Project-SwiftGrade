# Project SwiftGrade

## Overview

Project SwiftGrade is an advanced academic software suite designed to facilitate automated grading and analysis of student assessments through the integration of Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies. This repository serves as the central hub for all core components, including preprocessing modules, AI/ML models, user interface elements, and utility scripts.

The primary objective of SwiftGrade is to streamline the grading process, reduce manual workload for educators, and enhance the objectivity and consistency of assessment evaluations. By leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning models alongside traditional checksum verification techniques, the system aims to accurately interpret and score both multiple-choice and essay-type responses.

## Key Features

- **Automated Grading Pipeline:** From input preprocessing to model inference and result aggregation.
- **Hybrid Scoring Mechanism:** Combines checksum-based answer validation with AI-driven essay analysis.
- **Modular Design:** Supports easy extension and maintenance through well-isolated components and branches.
- **Cross-Platform UI:** Developed with Flutter to ensure consistent user experience across devices.
- **Extensible Dataset Management:** Facilitates incremental dataset updates without disrupting core functionalities.

## Installation and Setup

To ensure reproducibility and environment consistency, it is strongly recommended to use Python virtual environments (`venv`) or containerization (e.g., Docker) for dependency management.

### Example Setup Using `venv`:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate      # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Branching Strategy
main: Stable production-ready code. All features must be fully tested and reviewed before merging.

dev: Active development branch for UI/UX enhancements and integration testing.

models: Dedicated branch for AI/ML model experimentation, training updates, and performance benchmarking.
